Hey there!

It’s Martin, welcome to my blog. I appreciate you being here (seriously).

On this website is where you’ll find useful blog posts about programming and Fallout Shelter
Online, but soon I’ll also be writing about other games. So stay tuned! Great content and
awesome gaming tips await you (you wouldn’t want to miss that). I always do my best to make
sure the writeups here are as informative as they can, to make your visit worthwhile.

Just to give you a little background, I’m a blogger, web developer, and user interface (UI)
designer who loves to travel and take beautiful photographs so that I can share them with you
on my other site. It’s a travel diary where I upload images (of various stunning locations in
Czech Republic) with a few descriptions in between to somehow give you the experience of
being there. You should really check it out, and you can do so by visiting this website:

If you want to know about my professional background and experience (I do front and back-end
web development), my resume is also available **[here](https://martin.toms.click)** for your reference.

Martin Toms

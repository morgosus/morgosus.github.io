Alas, the European Union decided it's necessary. From that point on, every website that uses cookies must have a cookie banner.

Do note that this banner will be back after six months or if you delete your cookies, compliments of our
overlords over at the EU.

## What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small files (so small that you most likely won't notice their size on your computer), pretty much local variables, stored in the user's machine. Some stuff is better stored with you, than us.

## What Does This Website Use Cookies For?
Mainly? Google Analytics. It allows me to see where the visitors are from, what they browse, that kind of stuff. Now, before you get creeped out, it won't tell me your personal details. For example it can tell me that a lot of people from Vietnam read an article about Fallout Shelter Online. That, in turn, tells me to write more about that topic. The data in Google Analytics stays there for 38 months and can not be used to identify individuals.

## How Do I Get Rid Of Cookies?
You can always delete your cookies, or disable them in your browser. Note that this will reduce the functionality of many websites. Cookies are used for everything from logging in to customization. If you change your mind about your consent, you may click the revocation button below.

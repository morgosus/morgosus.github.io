I'll talk about some nifty things within the, at least in my eyes, redeemed game. Sure, at its beginning, it was just one of Todd Howard's failed hyped-up cash-grabs. Still, in the past few years, it's really made a rather stunning comeback in terms of playability and features.

The game receives new updates with some semblance of new content, mainly expanding upon the Fallout 76: Wastelanders update. There's also a system of dailies that ties into a "scoreboard" that gives you daily rewards.

If I had to sum up the game in the current state, I'd say it's pretty much a Fallout 4 online game. Sure, there are some bugs, but looking back to the Skyrim experience... I'd say that's a standard feature with Bethesda.

## Story: What's With The Human NPCs Anyways?

You see, the game started out in West Virginia in the year 2102; currently (2021), the year is 2104, so you can imagine that quite a few things have changed in-game. However, that's still far earlier than the other games, which are set some 200 years later.

You start off as a vault dweller (duh) from the Control Vault 76. Its mission? To open 20 years after the war and rebuild the civilization. The thing is, some evil things lived in West Virginia after the war... and there was a good reason why there were no NPCs. So let's just say that you wouldn't want to run into whatever they ran into without Vault-Tec supplies and preparation. And in the middle of a nuclear winter.

That's right - the humans in this part of America were caught off guard by *something*, and that's why there were no *human* NPCs. It was a hugely debated issue; to some, the game felt empty. I must admit, it felt that way a bit; I missed the raider attacks. But then again, you always had *other* enemies to deal with and robots to trade with.

### Fortunately For Us Though - Humans Came Back!

Just not the inhabitants of Appalachia. The human NPCs we meet are people coming in from surrounding regions. Whether they be settlers searching for a new home, the raiders searching for the settlers' new home, or the Brotherhood of Steel searching for the remains of advanced pre-war technology.

So, let's begin.

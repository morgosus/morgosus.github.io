I claimed that attachments are pieces of armor that you can slap onto your dwellers. I was right, but let's go more in depth this time.

First off, you can get attachments everywhere - you can get them from missions, events, purchase them for Pre-War money (4 items from any set - not the full set! just any 4 items, rare or better), or purchase them for Silver Vault Tokens (10 tokens = a single SSR attachment of choice, both set and type can be chosen).

Once you unlock **master** difficulty missions, you can complete those to get a single random SSR attachment. From my experience it's usually the minuteman gloves ðŸ˜‚.

Each attachment has the following traits:
- Rarity (N - SSR): Affects the number of stats the item improves (up to 4 at SSR) and maximum power
- Level (1 - 60): Affects the numeric stat improvement
- Set Affinity, as in - it belongs to a set
  - Set bonuses
  - Optional: Dweller specific bonus
- Stars and Medals (initially 0, gained through remaking, which is unlocked at **level 33**)
  - Up to 2 additional stats the set will improve; these may include HP, Damge, Dodge or any other stat

Again, I'll give you an example: The **VAMPIRIC MIGHT** attachment set.

Wearing this set will grant your dweller +7% damage (may not seem that powerful, but it actually can be hundreds, if not a thousand points of damage) if they wear 2 pieces, which further grants the ability to steal 25% of their damage as healing. Nifty, right? Now, if you equip this set on **Desdemona**, she - and she alone - will, every time she loses 5% of her health, restore 3% of her damage's worth in healing. Awesome, right? She's a self-healing dweller. Sure, not as powerful as a healer, but some healing is better than none - especially when her class is just an attacker.

## Upgrading attachments

![Upgrading attachments](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/upgrade.jpg)

I once said...
> A great way to increase power is to upgrade attachments. Your dweller can wear 4 attachments (head, torso, hands and feet) and that can net you, even at the lowest level - assuming you upgrade them to level 60 - 2688, 4032, 6112, or 9120 power. Based on the rarity, 9120 being four level 60 SSR attachments, of course. This can be boosted even higher once you gain access to tool remaking.[^1]

... and this is the glorious time when I expand upon the remaking statement. Upgrading a piece of gear is easy, you can either use **upgrade materials** (which drop from pretty much everything in the game, especially the Trinity Tower, events and guild events, also locations on the map), other attachments (transfer their upgrade EXP to another item) or use the swap feature within the workshop room. Simple stuff. It just takes a lot of materials (270 superb upgrade materials to bring an SSR item from level 1 to level 60). Remaking is a tiny bit different.

Be smart. You do not need 10 sets of fully upgraded SSR gear. You only need 5 pieces, unless you're going for specific ones for specific dwellers. Take the Mysterious Treasure for example. You'll have to complete lications with dwellers of one faction... you will not have all dwellers maxed out, so... just unequip the gear from your main squad, pop them onto those unlucky guys from the institute and once they're done, return the equipment to the rightful owners. There, 5400 superb materials saved and 5 dwellers still got to use maxed out SSR attachments.

Do be aware that you were vulnerable in PVP in the time you unequipped your dwellers... but unless you're among the top 5, it doesn't really matter, you'll just kill whoever killed you and be back in business. Trust me, at this moment I'm number 1 in Combat Zone on my server.

## Level 33: Attachment Remaking 101

![Remaking attachments](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/remake.jpg)

The items which play a role within further upgrading your attachments are
1. **Superb Attachment Upgrade Material,** while it is used for upgrading the level of attachments, its main purpose in life (or I guess unlife, since it's an object) is being used for remaking at a rate of 50 per star. The first star costs only 10. Medals cost more, usually raising by 10 per medal.
2. **Attachment Kit**, which comes in four varieties - head, torso, hands and feet - gained from the Mysterious Treasure location, events and special deals. Used at a rate of a few to a few hundred per star (yup, not used for medals).
3. **Enclave Kit**, which comes only in one variety, but is used for all attachments, once they reach 10 stars. An enclave kit can be exchanged for a certain amount of attachment kits if you play around with Mysterious Treasure and unlock a location store. They can also be bought through various deals, and gained through events. They are much rarer and are used at the rate of 39 per medal.
4. An **Adaptability Chip** is needed once per remade item. Once its used, it will grant your item additional stat or two (N, R - 1 stat, SR and SSR attachments gain 2 stats). The stats gained are random, you may roll dodge and resistance, or you may roll HP and damage, who knows. Either way, you're allowed to dismiss the upgrade at the cost of the chip and the 10 superb materials used. You might want to do that if your main attacker gets dodge instead of damage.
5. An additional useful material is the **Formatting Chip**, which allows you to reset or roll your upgrades back.
  - Reset removes all the stats at the cost of 1 chip per item, it returns some used materials back (kits, not chips)
  - Rollback does the same, but it keeps the first star in, allowing you to reclaim some materials, upgrade a different attachment piece, while also keeping the old item rolled-back item with the initial stats. That way you can return to it anyways and the stats (which you probably like, such as HP + damage) are kept. You just need kits at that point to bring the item to its former glory.

SR and SSR attachments that have been sufficiently remade gain additional bonuses beyond just the two stats. These are called phases.

That's everything about dweller attachments in general, I think.

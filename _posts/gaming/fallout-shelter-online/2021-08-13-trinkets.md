A trinket is unlocked as an additional tab called "TRINKET," but only once a dweller reaches â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†. As I may have mentioned before, **not all dwellers** have trinkets. Most of those who do can be found within the VR room (unlocked at level 7).

There are some rare exceptions to the VR room rule. For example, Khan Maykr has a trinket, but you can only get it through pools.
{: .note}

Some honorable mentions are MacCready, Dogmeat, Piper, and Madison, as those are currently the only dwellers who aren't SSR with a trinket, at least as far as I know. Normal dwellers and Rare dwellers do not have trinkets, at least as far as I know.

Speaking of honorable mentions, make sure to visit the VR Room and claim 100 Nuka Cola Quantum for each "trinketable" dweller that you own, even before they reach 4 stars. That means the second you unlock MacCready, you are eligible to claim that free cola.

You may be wondering, just what exactly does a trinket do? All kinds of things. I'll give you two examples:

1. Strong the Super Mutant: **Macbeth** (Level 40, power 6806, 1 star)
   - Stats: + 24745 HP, + 920 Dodge
   - +16% Critical Damage Resistance in PVP
   - Glory of Humanity: AOE ability damage received -19%
      - When ability deals damage, 30% chance to stun the enemy for 1.5 seconds
2. Desdemona: **Stalker's Chip Reader** (Level 20, power 4617, 0 stars)
   - Stats: +569 Attack, +1185 Hit Rate
   - Relentless: +8.3% damage in PVP

So, the higher the level and rank (stars) of a trinket are, the more power it grants and the better its stats, even upgrading the abilities one has.

## How Do You Rank Them Up and Level Them Up?

![A trinket](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/trinket.jpg)

You'll need three types of items.

1. **Trinket Replica** - something specific to the dweller. For Strong, it's a copy of Macbeth; for Sarah Lyons, it's the banner of her squad. They're used for ranking up the trinket in multiples of 30 (30, 60, 90). You may either purchase them from pools, get them from rewards, or ideally, get them from the VR Room, which unlocks missions specific to the dweller who reached 4 stars (more stars = more missions), also called memory fragments.
2. **Treasure Diary** and **Dusty Diary** - Gained from Vault 112, VR Room, pools, it's used to rank up the trinket alongside a trinket replica. It's an SR and an SSR item, so it may take a while. They're usually used in amounts of 1 to 10.
3. **Memory Image** - Used to level up trinkets gained from FEV Infection guild events, limited events, or from trinket pools, these little buggers come in 4 rarities, which differ only in the amount of EXP they give to the trinket.

You can level up a 0-star trinket only to level 20, 1-star to level 40, and so on. I also mentioned a trinket pool. The trinket pool is in the Super Duper Mart and uses Trinket Tokens. Those are, much like a Gold Vault Token, a type of currency. Usually, if you draw 10 - 30 items, you're guaranteed an SSR item.

A particular type of trinket pool is the Wish pool. You pick two trinket fragments, and you gain an increased chance to get a 'wish.' You can get both of those trinket fragments (usually 5 and 30, but it can vary, I even got 10 and 30), or even double that if you're lucky. Once the wish is granted, it's marked as such and won't be fulfilled again. This pool has a guarantee after 30 draws, unlike most other ones with 10 draws. It's fair, as a single trinket of your choosing may grant you thousands of power... and waiting for a month till you get 30 from the VR Room may be painful.

## Some Final Words of Total Wisdom

It's great to have a trinket but remember, not having a trinket doesn't mean the world's end. One should also not choose one's squad just based on trinkets. After all, it comes up just to stat upgrades and potentially some chance increases... that's not always worth sacrificing an extraordinary ability. Let's take **Amata** for example. She's probably the best healer in Fallout Shelter Online, and she doesn't even get any trinket! At all! I still use her with great success - she heals my other dwellers, who do have a trinket ðŸ˜‰.

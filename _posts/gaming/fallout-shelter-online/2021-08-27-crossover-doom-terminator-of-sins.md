It's time to take a look at the latest Bethesda Crossover titled "Terminator of Sins." This time we're crossing over with the DOOM series once more. I realize that this article will not be helpful forever. Still, in the future, it may act as a sort of glimpse into the past. You know, for those who are either interested in looking back or those who missed it.

Before we begin, let me mention that the event runs on tickets. You have a cap of 20 tickets, which refresh over time. You can also buy up to 30 tickets a day at 150 Nuka-Cola Quantums for 10 tickets. So a regular incident costs 2 tickets, a boss fight costs 5. Reviving all your dwellers is free for the first 3 times, and then it's one ticket per complete squad revival.

## Event Characters
The crossover brings back the three pools from which three very special dwellers come. While they may not be that special in their abilities (except for the Marauder, who does seem to be quite interesting), they are certainly... out of place.

### Meet the Doom Slayer
> The Doom Slayer is the protagonist and playable character of Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth, Final Doom, Doom 64, Doom (2016), and Doom Eternal. He has also guest-starred in the Quake games such as Quake Champions and Quake III Arena.[^1]

### Marvel at the Sight of Khan Maykr
> The Khan Maykr or the Supreme Maykr is the supreme ruler of the realm of Urdak and the leader of the Maykrs, a highly advanced ancient race of alien beings. She serves as the main antagonist of Doom Eternal.[^2]  
> The Khan Maykr is one of the many Khan Maykrs birthed by the Singularity. This collective Maykr consciousness is destiny-bound to lead the Maykr race until the next Khan is born. [^2]

### Cower Before the Marauder
> A group of resurrected and corrupted Night Sentinels, the Marauders, are those who sided with the Khan Maykr and the Hell Priests against the realm of Argent D'Nur, becoming demonic sentinels after their deaths. As former members of the Doom Slayer's personal band of warriors, they have access to a wide range of very powerful techniques that make them arguably one of the most challenging foes the player will face throughout the campaign.[^3]

## Did You Know That There's a Just War Going On?
Should you actually get Khan Maykr, you might want to join this. The special mission rewards trinket pieces for him, as well as some trinket tokens. Half the requirements are completing the missions with the Maykr. The other is either using **above** 5-star dwellers or completing the encounter within 2 minutes. Oh, and you get only up to 3 wins a day.

## Path to the Boss
The event itself is centered around a boss; however, you must first get to him. The path to him is a set of incidents, much like in any of the other maps... or not. The incidents are filled with creatures from the DOOM universe. I'm talking zombies, cyberdemons, whiplashes, cacodemons, or even the terrifying marauders.

Have you ever wanted to throw Preston Garvey with his 'Another settlement needs your help' into a pit of demons just to see him die horribly? Well, now you can!

Overall the encounters aren't that difficult, but they are fun, as you get to fight zombies instead of the usual ghouls. You also gain **Sentinel's Crystal**s and **Doom's Mark**s.

Does your team highly outperform the enemies? Then, switch the difficulty of the encounter to boost your rewards!

## The Doom Sanctuary and The Good Old Glowing Sea Trader
Are you in need of some white promotion certificates? Maybe some high-level materials or resources? Well, you've come to the right place. The Doom Sanctuary provides you with all that in exchange for **Sentinel's Crystal**s. Obtain a sufficient amount, and a reward will be unlocked for you. The tips start at as low as 40 crystals and end with the ultimate prize of an SSR DOOM dweller at 10 000. Some notable mentions include the Doom Slayer's pet rabbit Daisy or the Classic Armor outfit for the Doom Slayer.

### What about the Glowing Sea Trader?
You unlock him once you reach the boss portal. Now, hear me out. Don't spend your **Doom's Mark**s on anything except resurrection kits and those AP boosters. Why? Well, you can boost your highest damage dealing dweller before each boss attempt (we'll get to that later), allowing you to get a full-blown ability hit in right as the fight begins. Those revival kits can be used to revive your dead dwellers - and believe me, they will die. Fortunately, revival only costs 1 ticket in this event.

## Apocalypse Ripatorium [Endless Wrath]
Once you reach the boss, more about him later, you will no longer gain Sentinel's Crystals from other parts of the event. Unfortunately. You do, however, gain the ability to get a trinket token, an 'advanced hell lunchbox,' and a bunch of other (insignificant) rewards from an endlessly repeatable mission. Mind you, it's not an outside combat one, which sucks, but still. It's not a bad way to boost your existing dwellers, especially with the wishing pool going right now.

I also mentioned an advanced hell lunchbox; it's just a box with a single SSR dweller poster with a 25% chance of containing a poster for the event dwellers. Of course, the **trinket token** is what you're after in this one, but an SSR poster is a nice freebie.

This mission is only repeatable up to level 50

## The Icon of Sin: Eternal Destruction [Final Battle]
Now, the golden peak of the event. The boss fight. 90 25%
![He's casting a spell... time to die](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/terminator-of-sins-boss.jpg?v=1.0.0)

There is a trick to killing the boss.
1. You need to survive. Bring two healers if you need to. Also, a good tank.
- I did some testing; you can do some severe damage even if you die before the instakill ability
2. You need to use the bloody chainsaw ability (to the right of the default selected demon blade) every time the boss summons demons
- He is weak only at that moment - and only against the chainsaw
- The blade is excellent at killing mobs around the boss, but you aim to hurt the boss, not them
3. You most likely won't do more than 20% damage every attack, don't worry, that's normal. The boss has an instakill ability
4. Just before your chainsaw recharges, turn your speed to 1x. That way, you won't miss the window of opportunity and maximize the damage from each chainsaw strike

Keep your phone charged. If you disconnect from the game while in the boss fight, it counts as a forfeit. That resets the boss back to 100%.

The boss fight is endless. That means you get to go again once you kill the boss. An initial first boss fight is much weaker (around 50 000 power on normal difficulty). Still, it quickly jumps to about 150 000 power at normal difficulty.

Does your team highly outperform the boss? I don't think it does!
{: .note}

The perk of killing the boss is an immediate influx of some **sentinel's crystals** (a few hundred) and a piece of the rare **Praetor attachment** set. If you can't kill him, don't worry - every 25% of his health you knock down nets you 90 of those shiny crystals!

Rewards past 10 000 points are not worth it, unless you've gone through the entire *Endless Wrath*.

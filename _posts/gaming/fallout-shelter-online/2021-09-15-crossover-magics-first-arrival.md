After an accidental trap trip, a magical explosion of sorts happened. The entire region around Mount Mabel changed. It's also the home of the intelligent Mount Mabel Monster - the red mutated deathclaw. Help the Khajit mage get back home and fix this mess!

Please add anything of significance I've missed in the comments :)
{: .note}

### Meet Saashi of the Khajit
> As a scholar of the Khajiit, a cat-like tribe, she was dedicated to exploring and protecting ancient ruins. When she was exploring a Nord ruin as usual, she accidentally triggered a strange trap and was teleported to the world of the wasteland....

## Spear and Shield

This time an incredibly simple special quest for the Blade Hero trinkets and some trinket tokens accompanies the main event. Complete 5 battles within 2 minutes and/or using the Blades Hero himself to earn a star.

> A new hand touches the beacon. -Meridia

The only hitch you'll run into might be the enemy power: 46 335, 90 688, 154 219, 245 295, and 245 295. The 10 star maximum earns you 40 Dawnbreaker replicas.

There are some unique enemies however, such as the Fire Model Robot, which I've only ever encountered within the hard levels of the Trinity Tower.

## Let's Check Out the Map!
Your resources (bread) are limited. Saashi bakes one bread per minute. How many loaves of bread do you have available each day? 24*60/12 = 120, which means, that even if you buy additional bread, you'll have a maximum of 180 guaranteed bread a day.

The map is split into parts. The second part of the map will open in 7 days from the beginning of the event. Till then - upgrade your Saashi, who knows what awaits her.

### General Dweller Information
Most of the incidents you'll come across will be pretty usual, and casual outside battles, but there will be an occasional building to explore too. There are however a few things to keep in mind.

- The equipment, stars, medals and level of each dweller "mercenary" is equal to Saashi's
  - Equipment is upgraded through materials and coins
  - Level is upgraded through EXP
  - Medals are upgraded through a blacksmith
- The perks of everyone are equal to Saashi's level
- You can only upgrade equipment to the level of Saashi's... well, level
- You have free range in choice of mercenaries. Pick based on DWELLER, not equipment. Most wanderer characters are pretty good, so I'd go with them. Other than the healer, of course.
   - Pay attention to the BOND of your dwellers, maximize the efficiency of your squad
- Potions, unlike resurrection scrolls, can be used in combat. You can save a dweller by healing them / removing their radiation while they're fighitng, if you switch to a lower speed.
- I recommend not farming stats until you progress to at least level 2 farms (for example an EXP spot numbered 2 or even better, 3 - one is east next to the merchant)
  - Aim for at least level 10, prioritize upgrading abilities and weapons, as your aim isn't just to survive - but to avoid as much radiation as possible by killing the enemy quickly. Surviving is nice, but it won't help if your max health at the end of an encounter reaches 10%.

### Tavern
The tavern allows you to choose and rest your dwellers. Make sure to always bring at least one:
- Healer, there's no radiation healers available - make the most of every life (Carrington). Without a healer you've wasted a "life".
  - Carrington is a great healer, but Marowski provides you with a constant stream of healing which might be useful in a freak accident. Of course, the more healers you have, the more radiation damage you'll take (due to not killing enemies quickly)
- Tank, as they will take damage instead of your other dwellers (Marauder), this is essential, as you don't know how much damage the enemy will deal.
- Attacker, who will kill your enemies (Doom Slayer is great at surviving). Always bring at least one character who can deal solid damage.

The rest is up to you, however - the more damage you deal, the less radiation you'll rack up... but also, the more damage you deal, the more vulnerable to attacks you are (e.g. it'll be easier to survive everything with two healers, as long as you don't run into radiation, but if you run into it, you're better off with more attackers and supports that help damage.)

### Smithy
Scattered across the map are blacksmith locations. Just click on it and all of your dwellers, Saashi included, will raise a star. So far I've found  two blacksmiths, just follow the path east.

### "Danger" Spot
Which I'm not sure what else to call is a big unknown for me at this moment. It appears to provide Saashi posters, but its power is higher than that of a regular incident.

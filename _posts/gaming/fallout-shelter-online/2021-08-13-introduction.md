Many of us are familiar with the legendary Android and PC game [Fallout Shelter](https://bethesda.net/en/game/falloutshelter). There was a time when all of my high school classmates had that tiny vault and spent all of their breaks improving it. However, not all of us may be familiar with the even more wonderful Android game [Fallout Shelter Online](http://fosol.gaea.com/en/).

> Fallout Shelter Online puts you in control of a state-of-the-art underground Vault from Vault-Tec Corporation, used to protect the population from total nuclear annihilation. Build a thriving Vault, recruit legendary Fallout heroes, explore the Wasteland, and solve the mystery of the missing Overseer.[^1]

And although the game is only available in Asia, as stated by the Fallout Shelter Online Team...

> Our game will only be live in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, and Japan. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause[^2]

... There is hope yet! If you're not from there, you needn't weep. There are ways to play it even from other regions. However, I cannot endorse them here, so I will only state the fact that it is possible. Just [Tap Tap](https://www.taptap.io) away and find a way.

The game is packed with features and content. It has a story, lots of characters, and ways to combine them and is a sort of pocket version of Fallout 4 combined with Fallout Shelter. You'll see characters from Fallout 4, whether from the Minutemen (*another settlement might need your help*) or the Brotherhood (*yes, Paladin Danse is still looking for that transceiver*). In addition, you'll be able to recruit many characters and add them to your vault.

That's one of the most crucial differences between Fallout Shelter and Fallout Shelter Online - the dwellers you have are already established people with traits and hopes. You can not breed them (*as much as we'd all like to see the effects of Strong's milk*), but you can gain them. So one could say that the game's goal is to build the ultimate team of Wastelanders, Dwellers and who knows what else, to take on any challenge found within the Commonwealth.

The second would be that you can spend an hour on the game and still have things to do, whether it be PvP, PvE, or just doing dailies and events.

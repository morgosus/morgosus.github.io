As of 15th September, there are two additional significant mechanics tied to the classroom. Let's take an in-depth look at them because knowledge is power.

## Let's Begin with the Original One - Dweller Gallery
This one is relatively straightforward. You can claim a power + HP + attack stat bonus for all dwellers you own as you unlock and rank up your dwellers. Generally speaking, it's around 6 - 20 power's worth for each star/medal. The higher the dweller, the higher the reward, of course. So consider this a sort of consolidation prize for pulling and upgrading unwanted dwellers.

## Then There's the Mentorship System
You'll unlock slots for upgrading the classroom. You get 2 slots "free" (well, for power) in each category. Additionally, you can open the third slot in each section for 500 Nuka Cola (not worth it, more on that later).

There are role-oriented categories:
- Guardian (Tank Role)
- Attacker (Role)
- Healer (Role)
- Support (Role)

As well as bond/faction ones:
- Boston (Goodneighbor Bond)
- Commonwealth (Allies Bond)
- BOS (Brotherhood of Steel Bond)
- Institute (Bond)
- Wasteland (Sole Survivor Bond)
- Wilderness (Wilds Wanderer Bond)

This gives you a grand total of 10 mentor sections, with 20 free slots and up to 10 for Nuka-Cola Quantum (at 500 NCQ each, the total cost being 5000).

### What Bonus Do Dweller Levels Give?

First off, you can only assign SR, SSR, and UR dwellers. Also, note that the power change displayed when you switch out dwellers is relevant to your **current** attack squad, as in the dwellers in your vault room. These bonuses affect every dweller, but the target (for example, the target for Guardian category are tanks) role/bond member gains a higher one. There's a default bonus of 0.1% stat increase.

Each dweller can be a mentor in only one slot. A bond may be beneficial if you have multiple dwellers in your team, while roles are more of a general utility.

Bonus applies to the mentor as well.

Here's an example of how much increase you can expect.

SSR | HP Target | HP Target | Stats Target % | Stats Others %
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† | 160 | 80 | 0.3 | 0.2
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† | 240 | 120 | 0.3 | 0.2
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… | 320 | 160 | 0.3 | 0.2
ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–â˜…â˜… | 560 | 280 | 0.5 | 0.3
ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ– | 720 | 360 | 0.7 | 0.4

Let's say we have twenty â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† dwellers assigned. That'd be a minimum bonus of 1600 HP and a 4% increase. But, of course, considering every dweller has different roles, bonds and I only took the "Others" stat as the minimum, it's probably going to be around double that. So overall, I do not think the 500 Nuka slots are worth it unless you have a lot of spare Nuka or are one of the top 2 ranks.

As you lose nothing by assigning dwellers, make sure to slot every place you can.
{: .note}

Choose role over the bond, unless you have more bonded dwellers than the roles in your squad. As power is the same everywhere (not counting rarities like the world arena), it's safe to assume that this bonus carries over to activities like GvE.

## And Finally, the Expansion of the Bonds
This one is a bit trickier, but I'll simplify it. You can unlock bonus stats for **all** dwellers, much like the dweller gallery, but only when you get the combinations listed within the team manual tab to 5 stars. For example, the Detective and Reporter team in the Sole Survivor tab. You'll be able to claim 8 defense and 8 Resistance when you get both Nick and Piper to 5 stars.

Upgrading these is pretty expensive and requires a lot of event (and World Boss) patience and effort.

Luckily the bonuses are so tiny that you're not missing anything if you don't get a single bond upgrade. So technically speaking, the only worthy upgrade is the team skills, which can reduce radiation and so on. Still, those only unlock at team level 10... that's a lot of upgrades, and this is probably more of a minmaxer thing or a long-term tiny upgrade opportunity.

You can upgrade a team skill using Bond Albums and dwellers using nameplates. Get them within the Mysterious Treasure, or they can be bought for the Boston Clarion (Zenith Arena, World Arena, Guild GvE, World Boss). However, you can only upgrade dweller bond levels once they reach the 5-star requirement and unlock their combo.

To be honest, the price tag of 25 000 sugar bombs for a **random** nameplate is way too much, so focus on the much more profitable attachment kits.

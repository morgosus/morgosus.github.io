The nutty aroma of a piquant beverage disappeared hours ago, and celestial dancers emerging from a coffee mug stopped creeping around your office as the drink cooled down. Not a sip. Not even a single gulp of that divine sharpness rolling over your tongue. And what was it that kept you busy today? Ah, yes. The water purification plant was on fire. The power generator is flooded. And the scrapyard became a crapyard with all the roaming animals defecating on the floor.

Overseeing the whole vault is undoubtedly an exhausting and thankless job. You need to relax. Find a hobby. And maybe a friend or two. Perhaps an overseer lady with a nice pair of... Perks, you pervert! And luckily for you, there is an easy way to find companionship in The Commonwealth wasteland.

## Guilds!

They have everything you seek. Love, betrayal, hate, and drama. And did I mention *shinies*? A lot of shinies to satisfy your **greed**! Let's take a closer look at one of these guilds!

![Welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/base-preview.jpg)

Your guild base will be supported by one of the existing factions, and its aesthetic will change depending on the flag you'll fly. As a future leader, you can choose between Brotherhood, Minutemen, and Institute. Once the guild is adequately established and paid for, you can't change your political affiliation. So be careful with your choice if you are the one who will be smothered by the leader's responsibilities.

Walk with me, Overseer, I'll show you our first stop – and for the sake of your irradiated brain, here's our itinerary.
1. **Guild Base**
- Shop
- Lobby
- Armory
- Command center
- Communication center
2. **Currency, Materials, and Benefits**
- Honor Points
- Old Military Supplies
- Ammunition Box
- Coil Magnet
- Spring Box
3. **Base Upgrades**
- Array Light
- B.O.S. Container
- Cola Vendor
- Combustion Motor
- Kinetic Energy Gun
- Partners
- Steel Door

## Guild Base
### Shop

Guild offers another source of desirable items, and the honor system took the place of the currency. I'll cover activities that'll net you **Honor Points** in the next part. For now, let's assume you share my daily earnings, which is approximately 14 000 HP. I will also write two prices, as it's possible to get better deals after certain _base upgrades_ are purchased.

- 1x Danse's Poster:
  - 8 000 / 7 200 Honor Points
  - Paladin Danse is a pretty decent attacker, but is he worth it? Yes and no. You won't achieve any miraculous progress with a single poster a day. Therefore relying on the Guild Shop as the source of your posters is not a good idea. But if you already possess a lot of them, buying the rest to rank up might get you the very much needed upper hand.
- 1x Carrington's Poster:
  - 8 000 / 7 200 Honor Points
  - Carrington is not a bad PvP healer, but the required investment makes this offer seem worthless. Unless you are close to the next rank, skip this option.
- 1x Kellogg's Poster:
  - 8 000 / 7 200 Honor Points
  > If I had a gun with two bullets, and I was in a room with Hitler, bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
  - Replace Toby from the Michael Scott (The Office) quote with Kellogg's name, and you'll see how unattractive this offer is.
- 1x Dogmeat's Poster:
  - 4 000 / 3 600 Honor Points
  - Can be bought in a faction shop.
- 1x Kells' Poster:
  - 4 000 / 3 600 Honor Points
  - Can be bought in a faction shop.
- 1x Tom's Poster:
  - 4 000 / 3 600 Honor Points
  - Can be bought in a faction shop.
- 1x Z2-47's Poster:
  - 4 000 / 3 600 Honor Points
  - Can be bought in a faction shop.
- **1x Sia's Poster**
  - 2 000 / 1 800 Honor Points
  - **No reason to beat around the bush. Sia is the best offer you can get from the Guild Shop.** She's the only R Dweller whose posters can be bought in bulk, and since water is essential no matter the stage of the game you're in, she is **the** deal. You will accumulate a huge amount of Honor Point simply by being an active member of any guild. That will most likely make her your first R dweller that will reach 3 medals.
- 1x Blue Attachment Guild special sale:
  - 2 000 / 1 800 Honor Points
    – Trinity Tower, Easy and Medium Incidents are much better sources
- 1x Purple Attachment Guild special sale:
  - 10 000 / 9 000
    – Trinity Tower,  medium Incidents are better sources
- 1x Fine Attachment upgrade material:
  - 1 000 / 900
    – What's even the purpose of this?
- 1x Superb attachment upgrade material:
  - 2 500 / 2 250
    – Trinity Tower, GvE, and Vault 112 will net you more purple tools for a much better price, granting you dozens, if not more, per day

### Lobby - The Primary Source of Military Supplies & Honor points

Heart of the base, this is the place where friendships are made! From here, you will send dwellers as mercenaries to do the bidding of other Overseers. But, don't be afraid; dwellers are excellent at multitasking, and their original work in your vault won't be interrupted.

Production assistance lasts for one hour and can be repeated up to three times a day (this number will increase with guild upgrades).
![Assist window in the lobby](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/assist.jpg)
Suppose you have a dweller with a particular set of skills. In that case, you can lend them out as a sellsword that can be hired for _incidents, challenge missions_ and _faction quest incidents_. Your (wo)man-at-arms will return after 24 hours and bring juicy loot with them.
![~~Cancer~~ Roach King and Desdemona here to kick ass and chew bubble gum](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/mercenaries.jpg)
And what **exactly** will you get in return? Shinies. A lot of shinies. Once your dweller finishes the work, he'll bring in a small number of resources, including **Honour Points** and **Old Military Supplies**. Daily work via the lobby is the most steady income you'll have.

Before we move forward... let's look at this soldier.
![Insubordinate, drunk, and lazy. Don't be like him. Help your guildmates!](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/drunkard.jpg)

### Armory & Guild Reinforcements

![At ease, soldier!](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/power-armor-knight.jpg){: .image-float-left}
Here we keep our most prominent soldiers combat-ready. Guild members can hire Guild Reinforcement for Rescue Missions and Guild Wars, but keep in mind the 24-hour cooldown after using this powerful combat unit.

Old Military Supplies - brought back to you by mercenaries - can and should be donated to increase the effectiveness of your Power Armor Knight. Don't worry! You'll have no other use for the supplies, and you'll receive a decent amount of Honor Points for each box you'll donate, too! Who could say no to that?

### Command Center

You are in the presence of a Senior Paladin!  Mind your manners, Overseer!  This is our command center; if the lobby is the heart of our base, then the Command Center is its mind. We scramble our units every week and send them to the wasteland to participate in Rescue Ops.

Rescue Mission starts every Wednesday and lasts until Monday. There's a lot of beautiful technology to be rescued and many dangerous monsters in our way. No, I'm not talking about those pesky rotters or raiders. I'm talking about apex predators, the strongest, the most dangerous Brobdingnagian hellspawn roaming The Commonwealth!

#### Things All GvE (Guild vs. Event) Fights Have in Common
1. You can hire Guild Reinforcements to assist you in combat.
2. You can attack three times a day.
3. You will receive Guild Honor rewards based on your damage dealt to the boss.
4. Rewards for killing the boss will be distributed among the participating members after its defeat.
5. After the last boss of the wave is killed, stronger enemies appear.
6. After the event is over, the main reward will be distributed among the members.

![And the bosses? Let's take a look at the hologram.](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/gve-main.jpg)
First, we have an Alpha Deathclaw. And when I say Alpha, I mean THE Alpha. This thing will eviscerate a knight in a matter of seconds. So tread lightly around this one, especially when it gets angry.

The second one is the infamous Mirelurk Queen, be careful; her putrid spit can irradiate you.

And the last one is, of course, humanity. Well. In a way. Weapon of mass destruction. Sentry Bot. Be careful; his high energy resistance might be a bit problematic.

#### Strategies
- It is advised to go all-in in the boss fight; you are rewarded for the damage done, and the first few waves are not difficult. I'd recommend you use as many attackers as possible without compromising your effectiveness (a dead attacker is a bad attacker).
- My usual composition for easier fights is attacker-attacker-attacker-support-support. I'll switch one attacker for a healer in harder fights.
- Attackers – use whoever you have. As long as they are dealing damage, they should do.
- Supporters – Sarah  (Antagonizer's Attachment) and Piper (Overseer's Initiative) are great "starting "dwellers. They will boost the team's damage by lowering the enemy's resistance and increasing attack speed. Any support class that can directly or indirectly boost your damage output is a must.
- Healer – the choice is yours for the Deathclaw and the Robot, but since Mirelurk Queen can cause rad damage, Madison or Nerriah are worthy assets in that fight.
#### And rewards?
- Honor Points for each combat
- Honor Points and purple attachment tools for each defeated boss
- And after event rewards (based on the score of your guild) can be separated into
  - Honor Points, Ammunition Box, Coil Magnet, Old Military Supplies, Spring Box
  - A wide variety of rewards that goes directly into your pocket. This can include SSR poster boxes, Orange rarity attachments boxes, and many more.

### Communication Room
Where the hell do you think you are going, soldier? You're not ready to hear about Communication Room and FEV Event yet. I'll let you know when the time comes. Outside. Now!

## Currency, Material, and Benefits of the Guild

### Honor Points
As you already know, Honor Points are Guild's currency. Let me tell you _again_, where can you acquire these points.
- Donation of Old Military Supplies.
- Production Assistance via Lobby
- Combat Assistance via Lobby
- GvE damage
- GvE boss killing
- GvE after-event reward
- by providing building materials (ammo box, coil magnet, spring box)

### Old Military Supplies
- Production Assistance via Lobby
- Combat Assistance via Lobby
- GvE after-event reward

### Ammunition Box
- GvE after-event reward
- used for building effort

### Coil Magnet
- GvE after-event reward
- used for building effort

### Spring Box
- GvE after-event reward
- used for building effort

### Benefits
Before I show you outside, let's talk about one significant benefit of being in a guild. ~~Two~~ three words. Pre. War. Cash.

Let's take a look at the *benefits*. You can buy up to three guild packs to receive a corresponding reward and give out a guild pack. These packs contain a certain sum of rewards from which each member will receive a random share. Each pack can be claimed a limited number of times and will expire after 24 hours. Also important to note, you **can** receive the reward from the very same pack you bought.
- **Guild packs:**
  - Processing Material Pack, containing 50 purple attachment tools, which might be a good offer for a desperate crafter, but otherwise skipped most of the time)
    Pre-war money pack is the sole reason I joined a guild in the first place (but don't tell them). You pay 666 Nuka Cola Quantum and get 700 PWC in return. Much better rate than in the Super Mart.
- **Red Bags:**
  - Be sure to check red bags every day. You can claim three packs a day for free Pre-War-Cash
  - The highest sum I received was around 145 PWC; the lowest one was around 15. Split the difference, and you got yourself a pretty nice deal!

## Base upgrades

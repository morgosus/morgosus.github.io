Attention Commonwealth and Capital Wasteland overseers! The FEV is spreading. Muster your forces and meet up at the following coordinates... the institute has kindly offered to provide us with support over the next 14 days. Let's not kid ourselves; it's probably their mess anyways.

![The map is beautiful](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/event/fev/map.jpg?v=1.0.0)
## The Map
The FEV map is divided into hexagonal tiles. You can move around freely; however, you can not cross the mountains, and the spaces between them are massive focal points of the FEV. The 900 000 power kind of focal points. The greenies have managed to set up camps at every entrance to the inner areas of the area.

To move around the map, take a tile. You can only attack tiles next to your own tiles, and up to the maximum tiles you can control - initially 5. After that, you can click on a tile and withdraw from it (abandon and lose it) to reduce your occupied tiles. Your tiles do not need to be connected. I suggest you keep only base tiles of level 5 and save 2 tiles free for movement until you settle near a boss. Green tiles are yours; blue tiles are allied.

You do not need to use 5 dwellers to take over a tile nor a base.

## Stamina
The dwellers you pick start off with 60 stamina; this will be set to 0 if, at any point, you decide to switch a dweller. That's why you should only change dwellers once you deplete their stamina.

Movement takes 6 stamina, as that's the minimum amount required to attack an empty tile. Stamina replenishes at a rate of 4 per hour. Keep all dwellers equipped with attachments. It will probably *not* affect their power, but it should give them the set bonus. If nothing else, this is useful for the world arena too.

![Make sure to boost your dwellers](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/event/fev/research.jpg?v=1.0.0)
## Dweller Power
All dwellers are boosted to level 65; however, they are not downgraded. The perks are boosted up **only to level 50**, maximum is 60. This means that your dwellers will stay at a higher level if you have level 66 - 75 dwellers.

The dwellers you use in FEV are further boosted up by research. You lose all diagrams when you rank up research; you do not need diagrams to boost research. This can give them thousands of additional power, as well as helpful stat boosts. Research is done using the resources (Diagrams and Mutant Biospecimen, a.k.a. BSP) gained through income and tile attacking. A garrisoned level 1 FEV Source grants you 300/h, while a level 2 grants 375 BSP/hour. You need to place a dweller of the required rank (stars/medals - 2 at level 1, 3 at 2, etc.) and bond for the boost. Boss tiles need a wilds wanderer at 4 stars (usually expensive or event dwellers). Please do not kill the boss if you don't have that, as you'd be weakening the guild - boss tiles are granted to the last attacking person, a.k.a. the person who kills the boss.

(Garrisoned dwellers can still be used to attack tiles, sources, and bosses.

Note that the game allows you to store only 8-hours worth of resources. That means you must log in every 8 hours to claim resources; otherwise, you're leaking them. You can claim them every 4 minutes, though.

![Progress and be rewarded](/assets/thm/gaming/foso/event/fev/rewards.jpg?v=1.0.0)
## Rewards
This part is easy. You can earn everything from posters to trinket tokens - both as a guild and as an individual. Just progress!

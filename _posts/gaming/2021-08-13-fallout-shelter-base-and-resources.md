The base of all things (*pun very much intended, applause please*) is your base - the vault. Your vault runs on the 
four basic resources, your effort and potentially a battle pass (*remember those handy - pun intended - Mr. Handies from 
Fallout Shelter? Well, you can buy it here too, along with additional rewards for dailies*).

## Let's break down the basic resources now.
There's no resource shortages as far as 'penalties for not having them',
but worry not - as soon as you reach higher levels, you won't have enough resources. Which is why you should try to be 
clever with them.

You can also get resources from various packs that you may procure through various ways (whether it be from missions or 
through straight up buying them). You may also find resources in other places, but let's talk about that some other 
time.

## Back to the topic at hand, let's break down the basic resources now.
**Power**, the Harry Potter scar shaped one, is the most important one... at least as far as base building is concerned. 
You can use it to expand or upgrade the vault. Pretty simple, right? It comes from the power generator room. My 
suggestion? Always upgrade the power generator first, that way your hourly income will always be at its potentially 
highest.

**Caps**, the... uh... cap shaped one. You use it the same way as in any other Fallout game, you buy stuff for them. Every 
gear upgrade, every cap shop, attachment making, ... if you're buying something simple, you're most likely using caps.

**Water**, the tear shaped one, is used to upgrade dweller (character) perks. Each dweller has a bunch of traits that require water to
upgrade. Why? Because why not. If I dump a truckload of water down your throat, you can be sure you'll gain some new
interesting powers. What powers? Uhhh... the power to explode? I don't know, leave me alone. You gain it through water 
purification rooms.

**Capacity**, the vault boy head shaped one, in the top left corner, tells you how many dwellers you can have roaming 
your vault. If you run out of space, you can always use the cryo room (the room in the thumbnail) to freeze the dwellers 
you're not using for production or combat - free of charge. You can increase it by building and upgrading living 
quarters.

Cutlery, better known as **food**, is the resource used to level dwellers up. You see, the wasteland is a place with great 
shortage of resources. If I feed you, you'll get stronger. Capish? That's why you should always donate food to shelters, 
that's how the homeless people level up (too much?). You generate it within the dinner.

**Summary** - you use water to level up perks, gaining ability improvements or stat bonuses; food for leveling up; caps 
for buying basic items and power to upgrade your vault.

## But Martin, what are those other three resources on the right side of the screen?
Those are, what I call, the *advanced resources*. Let's take a look at them, top to bottom.

**Nuka-Cola Quantum** - used for purchasing useful items, speeding things up, purchasing the other two resources and many, 
many other things. Usually when something costs Quantum, it will cost more the next time. The price will, however, drop 
back down to the lowest one the next day. You can get it for free, or you can buy it. Also, you can speed most stuff up 
for a few pieces of Quantum, like 1 - 20, also, anything under 2 minutes is free. (Unless it's the overseer's office, 
that usually takes hours to complete and speeding it up would cost anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred, based on 
the level you're upgrading to). So, it's used in units to hundreds, depending on what you're buying and how rare it is.

**Pre-War Cash** - used for purchasing dwellers, and other nifty things. You can get it for free, or you can buy it. More 
about dwellers some other time. It's used in hundreds to thousands.

Finally, there's the funny looking pill. That's **Rad-X** for you. You need Rad-X to travel around the wasteland. Most 
missions will cost you 10 - 30 Rad-X. You regain it at a rate of 1 every 6 minutes. Each day you can also buy 120 Rad-X 
for a small price of 20 Nuka-Cola Quantums, then 40, 60 etc. Missions may hand you capsules with Rad-X that contain 
(based on their rarity) 60, 120, or 200 Rad-X. Vault 112 is one of the best places to get Rad-X, so make sure to keep 
at least 200 - 300 pre-war cash on you, and never miss the trader there. More about Vault 112 later.

There are other currencies, but I'll get to them once they become relevant.

## Who should you put in the production rooms?

Well, production dwellers. Some dwellers (namely the RARE - blue and COMMON - white ones) have production perks. That's 
nuclear physicist - power, workoholic - caps, ~~plumber~~ water expert and the perfect chef. Rare dwellers have these 
prepended with the word High-Level. Basically, their perk makes more of the resource on its own. You can upgrade these 
perks for water. A level 1 high-level water expert perk makes 120 water/H. A level 45 one makes 1176/H. It's worth the 
water.

There is a downside to water upgrading, and that's the fact that both combat and production traits use it, so you have 
to choose which ones to upgrade first. I usually go for production, as they're much cheaper and make me more resources, 
which I can in turn use for upgrading my combat dwellers.

You can boost the **tools** used for resource making the same way you'll boost equipment for combat. Production dwellers 
don't need combat equipment and only need 2 (the correct ones, based on the resource they'll be making) tools. In my 
experience, common dwellers are much easier to upgrade, so they're worth using over rare ones as soon as they pass their 
production level. My 3/10 upgraded rare physicist makes 2381 power an hour, while my 9/10 upgraded one makes 3334 per 
hour. The best part is - you can upgrade common dwellers through running missions or sweeping them, as they drop their 
upgrade materials (auto completion, uses the *Nuka Cherry* resource, which is gained through first completions, daily 
rewards, purchase at a rate 1:10 cherry - quantum etc.).

Rare dwellers, on the other hand, require either faction currencies or other expensive methods to upgrade, so unless 
you're ready to dump all of your Brotherhood of Steel points into Haylen, so that she can make less power than a common 
dweller, you're welcome to do so.

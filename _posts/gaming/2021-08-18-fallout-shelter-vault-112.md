One of the most useful locations, Vault 112 is both fun and plentiful. It's one of the best sources for **Rad-X** and upgrade materials. You may actually remember this one from Fallout 3:

> Vault 112 was one of the last Vaults to be constructed... (skip) ...It was intended for only 85 occupants, suspended in a virtual reality world for the indefinite duration of the Vault's experiment.[^1]

## So, What Actually Is It?

A simulation! Grab your main squad and head out in search of **Vault 112 tokens**. You pick a node to go to, finish it and move on. If it's a combat node (all of them are outside battles btw), you get to pick a buff. If it's a trading node, you get to trade. If it's a recruitment node, you get a virtual dweller who will aid you here. A single combat node within this "event" grants you anywhere from 100 to 600 tokens. The standard prizes are:

- 30 **superb attachment upgrade material** for 800 tokens
- **3 vacuum tube amplifiers** for 4800 tokens, allowing you to craft a single random SSR attachment, might be worth it to you
- A **treasured diary** for 4800 - debatable whether it's worth it
- ~~10 attachment kits (of each type) for 1200 tokens~~ **Mysterious Treasure** is a better and a cheaper source
- ~~A single trauma kit (revives a dweller in Vault 112) for 250 tokens~~ **Don't die**
- ~~A purple piece of a set of choice for 4800~~ **Not worth it**

Now, I crossed out a "few" prizes. Clearly, it's not worth it sacrificing 180 materials in exchange for something you can get elsewhere cheaper. Now that we know what we're in for, let's talk about the tips and tricks to beating it. Note that I haven't mentioned the **Rad-X** yet.

One more thing, once you beat a Vault 112 map, there are 2 more maps to go. You will gain additional tokens for beating the maps (hundreds). Your buffs will reset between each runs.

## Things to keep in mind

1. Don't die. Ever. If you die, you're going to either get stuck until the vault refreshes, or until you waste 250 - 1000 tokens for resurrection
  - **Bring a healer and a tank**, otherwise you'll be using healing nodes and sacrificing buffs / power for your squad
  - Don't take on challenges you know you will not beat
  - Do not prioritize healing over a combat node, unless it resurrects your fallen dwellers, as **each buff increases the power of your squad**
2. Virtual Dwellers are not worth the risk if you have to fight for them
  - You will not beat a squad of dwellers in the virtual pub
3. Contaminated nodes are easier than they look. The enemy might have 200 000 power, but there's only one enemy there. If you have a good tank and a healer, go for it even if you're tens of thousands of power below them.
  - They give 2 power batteries and lots of tokens, the second one is actually weaker
  - There are 2 contaminated nodes in each vault

4. Always visit trading nodes, if they have something you want, it's a secondary source of prizes and there's 0 - 2 of them in each run, usually on the second map.
  - Usually you'll want to bring 300 - 400 pre-war money in case you want to buy their stock
5. Prefer higher difficulty nodes if you can beat them
  - Not only do they give you more tokens, they also hand out stronger buffs
6. Prioritize higher rarity buffs, they increase your power more
7. Do not take buffs that don't apply to you
  - If you do not have Strong, do not increase Strong's attack by 40%, rather take the 5% dodge bonus or whatever else is available.
8. Don't worry about radiation too much, especially if you come in with Neriah or Madison

## Trader nodes

As I've said before, trader nodes are a secondary reward. You should always take advantage of them. I usually bring 300 - 400 pre-war money that I have in reserve just for this vault. It can sell all 3 rarities of Rax-X in bulk, that means 600, 1200 or even 2000 Rad-X can be gained per trader. Some traders have none, but some traders even sell multiples. The highest Rad-X amount I've ever gotten from a single Vault 112 run is somewhere at 4000 Rad-X.

Consider this, if a trader sells you 10 packets of 120 for 160 pre-war money, that's cheaper than the cheapest price when buying it directly. That'd be 20 for 120, then 40 for 120 etc. This way you obtain 120 for 16, but ten times over.

There's a lot of things to do in Fallout Shelter Online. Sometimes I don't even do all the daily things, because there's just so much to do and I forget something haha. Let's take a look at what's up for grabs!

daily quests
  - Crisis Challenge (60 Rad-X) → Research
    - Rads Challenge / Resistance Challenge
  - Ruins (free) → Resources
    - Pillaging becomes less viable once you level up, as enemies become very tough (± 300k power at top level)

## Requires No Rad-X
quests in mysterious treasure
  - the higher the trader, the higher the rewards
travel album

This will be a mostly numeric post with tables.

## Posters Required

| Posters 	| N   	| R   	| SR  	| SSR 	| UR  	| Cert
|---------	|-----	|-----	|-----	|-----	|-----	| -----------
| â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†   | 10  	| 10  	| -   	| -   	| -   	| 0
| â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†   | 20  	| 20  	| 30  	| -   	| -   	| 0
| â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†   | 50  	| 50  	| 50  	| 80  	| 80  	| 0
| â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†   | 100 	| 100 	| 100 	| 100 	| 100 	| 0
| â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…   | 200 	| 200 	| 200 	| 200 	| ?    	| 0
| **Total**       	| **380** 	| **380** 	| **380**  	| **380** 	| ?   	| **0**
| ðŸŽ–â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…   | 150 	| 120 	| 100 	| 40  	| ?   	| 20
| ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–â˜…â˜…â˜…  	| 150 	| 120  	| 100  	| 50  	| ?   	| 40
| ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–â˜…â˜…   | 150  | 120 	| 100  	| 70  	| ?   	| 60
| ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–â˜…   | 230 	| 200  	| 150  	| 70   	| ?   	| 80
| ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–  | 230 	| 200 	| 150  	| 70  	| ?   	| 100
| **Total**       	| **1290** 	| **1140** 	| **980**  	| **680** 	| ?   	| **300**

Considering that
- All dwellers can be upgraded by using the posters of other dwellers of the same rarity who've reached ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ– (Ratio 3:1)
- N dwellers can be farmed in incidents at 4 posters per incident (or 10 poster draws)
- R dwellers can be drawn (10 poster draws)
  - Some bought at 30 faction reputation per poster
- SR dwellers can be farmed in hard missions at 1 poster per incident (or 30 poster draws)
  - Other means include 1 poster per 120 memory shards
- SSR dwellers can not be realistically farmed, but can be raised through other means once their level reaches 5 stars (or 80 poster draws)
  - Promotion posters
  - Combat zone, world arena, Cola, ...

Then to get a single dweller, you'd need to - at the very least (discounting the posters you gain by chance, and from non-direct draws):



| Draw Pools | N   	| R   	| SR  	| SSR 
|---------	|-----	|-----	|-----	|-----
| First Level   | 1  	| 1  	| 1   	| 1 
| â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…   | 38  	| 38  	| 12.66  	| 4.75
| ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–   | 129  	| 114  	| 32.66  	| 22.66

Or:

| Clear / Sweep 	| N   	| Rad-X (10 / 20) | SR  	 | Rad-X (20 / 30)
|---------	  |-----  | ------	|------  | -----
| First Level | 3     | 30 / 60     	| 8      | 160 / 240
| â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…     | 95  	| 950 / 1900    | 380    | 7600 / 11400
| ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–ðŸŽ–    | 322.5 | 6460 / 9690  	| 980    | 19600 / 29400
